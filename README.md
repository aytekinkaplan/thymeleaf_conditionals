# Thymeleaf Conditionals Example

This repository contains an example Spring Boot project focusing on the usage of conditionals in Thymeleaf templates. 
It also demonstrates how to manipulate data from Java POJO classes and transfer it to an HTML table structure using Thymeleaf.

## Introduction

In this project, I've explored the usage of conditionals in Thymeleaf templates within a Spring Boot application. 
I've also learned how to retrieve data from Java POJO classes and present it in an HTML table format using Thymeleaf. 
By working on this project, I've gained hands-on experience with Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, and data manipulation techniques.

## Features

- Demonstrates usage of conditionals in Thymeleaf templates.
- Utilizes Java POJO classes to retrieve data.
- Presents data in an HTML table format using Thymeleaf.
